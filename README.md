# BOT-Framework : Build a great Automated Task executioner.

Using Microsoft BOT Framework to automate tasks.

Build and connect intelligent bots to interact with your users naturally wherever they are â€” from your website or app to text/SMS, Skype, Slack, Facebook Messenger, Office 365 mail, Teams and other popular services.

The Microsoft Bot Connector is a communication service that helps you connect your Bot with many different communication channels (Skype, SMS, email, and others). If you write a conversational Bot or agent and expose a Microsoft Bot Framework-compatible API on the Internet, the Bot Framework Connector service will forward messages from your Bot to a user, and will send user messages back to your Bot.
